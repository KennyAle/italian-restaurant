            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Restaurant was opened by award winning Chef Luciano Canova to offer residents and visitors of southern
                Brooklyn with the authentic Italian cuisine that the Restaurant's name has become synonymous with after
                the success of the Restaurant in Las Vegas. The restaurant now has a loyal following of its own,
                offering traditional Roman recipes passed down from Chef Luciano's family, as well as inventive Northern
                and Southern Italian preparations inspired by Chef Luciano's culinary education and travels.</p>
